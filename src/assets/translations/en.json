The significant number of repeat customers eloquently indicates that they trust us. A crucial component of our success remains the highest level of service. Our specialists develop a detailed cargo delivery plan, carefully monitor the entire route, ensure careful unloading, and exercise control over the cargo delivery until it reaches its recipient.",
      "thirdParagraf": "A significant part of our work involves freight transportation by road, and if necessary, we can organize sea freight. {{companyName}} is one of the few companies in Ukraine that specializes in multimodal freight transportation. This means that depending on the chosen delivery route, our specialists arrange the transportation of one cargo using different modes of transport. The client only needs to enter into a transportation agreement with our company, and all other concerns are taken care of by our experts.",

        "firstParagraf": "While many can handle the delivery of cargo within one country, especially within a single city, only a few logistics companies in Ukraine are equipped to handle international freight transportation. Indeed, international shipping is a complex and demanding task, as it requires comprehensive logistical support, preparation of all necessary documents for customs clearance, and the transportation of goods across the territories of other countries. It is also essential to work with various modes of transportation to deliver cargo quickly, safely, and at reasonable prices.",
        "secondParagraf": "The company {{companyName}} has been engaged in freight transportation within Ukraine for many years and also delivers goods to many countries around the world. An essential aspect of international cargo transportation is the quality of packaging to ensure that the cargo remains undamaged during the transportation process.",
        "thirdParagraf": "One of the key advantages of the company is the selection of an optimal delivery route for the cargo to its destination. In this process, not only road transportation but also sea freight can be utilized. The route is carefully chosen to guarantee safety, prompt delivery, and cost-effectiveness, which is particularly crucial for international shipments. The company's specialists accompany the cargo from the loading point to the unloading and handover to the recipient. Shipments are continuously tracked, allowing specialists to provide real-time information on the cargo's current location.",
        "fourthParagraf": "It is crucial that the international transportation of a single cargo is handled by one company because, in the case of numerous intermediaries, the transportation cost significantly increases, and the risk of receiving damaged or lost cargo substantially rises. {{companyName}} operates without intermediaries and guarantees the timely delivery of shipped goods in their entirety and intact. We deliver cargoes to many countries, leveraging our extensive experience to ensure the swift and cost-effective delivery of goods to the desired destination while prioritizing the integrity and safety of the cargo."

      "seaTransportation": {
        "firstParagraf": "Traditionally, rail transport is used for the transportation of cargoes of various dimensions, but in several cases, it is more practical to use other modes of transportation. International freight transportation is often carried out by road and sea. When it comes to delivering cargo to other countries on a different continent, using rail transport or trucks is not feasible, as they cannot cross the seas. Airfreight services are usually expensive, making maritime freight transportation with modern cargo ships the most optimal way to deliver cargoes, capable of transporting thousands of tons of diverse cargo.",
        "secondParagraf": "{{companyName}} has extensive experience in the field of freight transportation, both domestically and internationally. The company boasts an impeccable reputation as a reliable partner, earning trust even from large international corporations. Our company's specialists possess high qualifications and extensive experience, allowing them to develop the most optimal route for cargo delivery. While maritime freight transportation cannot deliver goods directly into the interior of the country, our experts can organize the transportation of goods from the port to the final destination.",
        "thirdParagraf": "During the many years of our company's operation, our specialists have developed the most advantageous routes and delivery schemes for both the company and its clients. In addition, our employees monitor the transportation of goods throughout the entire route, allowing them to inform the client about the location of their cargo at any time. Modern cargo ships can transport a vast amount of goods, making sea freight delivery advantageous for everyone.",
        "fourthParagraf": "Any international transportation, especially maritime shipping, involves the need to process numerous permits and accompanying documents. Gathering all these documents and correctly completing them can take a lot of time and effort for unprepared individuals. Our specialists are highly experienced in this matter and can swiftly handle all the necessary paperwork, preparing the cargo for customs clearance. Our company offers a comprehensive range of services, from loading the cargo to unloading and delivering it to the recipient. If you need to transport cargo, our company can quickly and affordably deliver it using any convenient method for you."
      },
      "multimodal": {
        "firstParagraf": "It is not always possible to organize economically advantageous freight transportation within a country or beyond using just one mode of transport. For example, when utilizing rail freight transportation, the destination may be at a considerable distance from the nearest railway station, necessitating the use of truck transportation to deliver the cargo to the final destination. A similar situation arises with maritime freight transport, as it requires delivering the cargo to the departure port, as well as organizing unloading and further transportation of the cargo to the destination, which may be quite far from the port.",
        "secondParagraf": "Not all companies can boast of organizing multimodal freight transportation and offer delivery using only one mode of transport. {{companyName}} is not one of those companies and provides its clients with the most favorable cooperation conditions by selecting the optimal route for transporting cargo and choosing the most economical delivery method. We utilize international road transportation and deliver goods by sea. If necessary, we can organize the delivery of cargo using various modes of transport on specific segments of the delivery route.",
        "thirdParagraf": "Our experienced staff calculates the most optimal delivery scheme for each client, which may involve transportation using various modes of transport. Thanks to this delivery organization, the transportation process is carried out quickly, and the client pays a minimum for the delivery. The company guarantees the safety of the cargo, and at any time, specialists can inform the client about the current location of the cargo. We accompany the cargo throughout the entire delivery route, monitoring the process from loading at the warehouse to the delivery into the hands of the recipient.",
        "fourthParagraf": "When utilizing multiple modes of transportation, there is a need for the documentation of various aspects. Our company has taken care of the comfort of our clients, and therefore, the entire logistics of transportation falls entirely on the shoulders of our staff. Simply entering into a contract with our company for expeditionary services is sufficient; our employees will then handle all the necessary documentation and organize the delivery of the cargo using the most advantageous route and cost-effective modes of transport on specific segments of the route. Thanks to our extensive experience and high level of professionalism, our specialists ensure fast and cost-effective cargo delivery, utilizing different modes of transport when necessary."
